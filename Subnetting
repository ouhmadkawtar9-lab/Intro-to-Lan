Subnetting means dividing a large network into smaller ones to improve organization and security.
For example, in a company, there are many departments such as accounting, finance, and marketing.
Each department needs its own separate network to avoid confusion and to ensure that the data of each department remains private and organized.

It also helps reduce network traffic and improves performance, because data flows only within each small network instead of the whole company network.
